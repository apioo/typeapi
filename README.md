# TypeAPI

## About

TypeAPI is an OpenAPI alternative to describe REST APIs for type-safe code generation.

> Our goal is to remove the need to develop custom client SDKs for an REST API.
> Once you have described your API with a TypeAPI specification you automatically get a ready to use client SDK.

For more information please visit our website at: https://typeapi.org/

The TypeAPI meta specification which describes the specification itself is located at `./specification/typeapi.json`.
We automatically push the specification to the [TypeHub platform](https://app.typehub.cloud/d/typehub/typeapi) where
you can see also a rendered version of the specification and download the auto generated models.
