# TypeAPI

## About

TypeAPI is an OpenAPI alternative to describe REST APIs for type-safe code generation.

> Our goal is to remove the need to develop custom client SDKs for an REST API.
> Once you have described your API with a TypeAPI specification you automatically get a ready to use client SDK.
