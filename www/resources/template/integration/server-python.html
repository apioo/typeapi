<p>The server code is based on <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>. The generated code contains the controller and model classes
  which are described at the specification. You only need to copy and paste the generated code into your source folder. A simple controller would
  look like:</p>

<pre class="typeapi-example"><code class="python">app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hello/world", status_code=200)
async def getMessage():
    # @TODO implement method
    pass

</code></pre>
