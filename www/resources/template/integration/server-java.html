<p>The server code is based on <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>. The generated code contains the controller and model classes
  which are described at the specification. You only need to copy and paste the generated code into your source folder. A simple controller would
  look like:</p>

<pre class="typeapi-example"><code class="java">@RestController
class App {
    @GetMapping("/hello/world")
    @ResponseStatus(200)
    HelloWorld getMessage() {
        // @TODO implement method
    }

}
</code></pre>
